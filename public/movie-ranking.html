<h1>The Best Movies of All Time According to Gavin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2> 
<hr/>

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>Very Positive movie. Witty form of satire. Many lessons to be learned.</p>

<h3>Blended</h3>
<p>Extremely humorous and laughable film. Filmed in the lost city of Africa.</p>

<h3>Kingsman</h3>
<p>Laughable action comedy of a secret service organization. Filled with humour and charisma.</p>
